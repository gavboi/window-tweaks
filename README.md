# window-tweaks
Script to give more control than normal over windows on your computer. Made with AutoHotKey, but the compiled .exe does not need AutoHotKey.

## Current Features

### Stick To Top
Windows will remain at the front of the screen even when they are not the active window.

Enable: Alt+W

Disable: Alt+Q

### Transparency
Windows become translucent so you are able to see behind them. 

Enable: Alt+T

Disable: Alt+R
